# Password-generator
Developed a Password Generator &amp; User Management System using Python (Tkinter) and MySQL, enabling secure password generation and role-based user management. Superusers can log in to retrieve and manage all user credentials stored in the MySQL database. The project includes OS-specific restrictions, making it operable only on Linux.
